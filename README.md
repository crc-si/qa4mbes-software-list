# A List of Bathymetry Survey Software Tools

* [qa4mbes-data-pipeline](https://github.com/crc-si/qa4mbes-data-pipeline) - a work in progress project with a suite of QA checks for Bathymetry data.
* [QC Tools by	HydrOffice](https://www.hydroffice.org/qctools) - The overall aim of this tool it to improve data quality issues, to reduce review and acceptance times, and ultimately to reduce ping-to-public times. 


* [Cube by	Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC)](http://ccom.unh.edu/theme/data-processing/cube) - an error-model based, direct DTM generator that estimates the depth plus a confidence interval directly on each node point of a bathymetric grid. In doing this, the approach provides a mechanism for automatically “processing” most of the data and, most importantly, the technique produces an estimate of uncertainty associated with each grid node. 

* [Caris HIPS and SIPS	by Teledyne](http://www.caris.com/products/hips-sips/) - HIPS and SIPS™ suite of products offers essential capabilities and professional grade tools for hydrographic data processing. Supporting over 40 industry standard data formats, HIPS and SIPS can easily integrate into any workflow.

* [MBQA by	mbsystem](https://www.mbari.org/products/research-software/mb-system/) - MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars. 

* [qps suite	by Quality Positioning Services](http://www.qps.nl) - A suite of tools for acquisition, post-processing and QAing seabed data 

* [HydroBib (Scansurvey) by	HydroCharting](https://hydrochart.dk/hydrobib/) - a freeware to work with seabed data with a number of QA/QC capabilities.

* [Hypack products](http://www.hypack.com/products) - a suite of tools for hydrographic data acquisition, post-processing, and management of products.

* [PosPac MMS	by Applanix](https://www.applanix.com/products/pospac-mms.htm) - software for Direct Georeferencing of mobile mapping sensors using GNSS and inertial technology. 

* [QINSy	by QPS](http://www.qps.nl/display/qinsy/multibeam) - QINSy is an integrated navigation system software package used extensively worldwide for acquiring and processing multibeam data.

* [Qimera 	by QPS](http://www.qps.nl/display/qimera/Home)

* [Seafloor Information System Quality Assurance (SIS QA) by	Kongsberg](https://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0397.nsf/AllWeb/17A82CA49F3A8E6EC1257FE2002C6F48/$file/403644-sis-qa-product-sheet.pdf?OpenElement) - SIS QA 2.0 includes tools to detect errors in a dataset. it is used in post-processing of Kongsberg Maritime echo sounder data.

* [LasTool by	Rapidlasso](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/) -  It is a collection of highly efficient, batch-scriptable, multicore command line tools to classify, tile, convert, filter, raster, triangulate, contour, clip, and polygonize LiDAR data (to name just a few functions).

* [QA4LiDAR by	FrontierSI (formerly CRCSI)](https://qa4lab.com/qa4lidar/) - Quality assurance tool for airborn LiDAR data acquisition. It includes QA checks for QA/QC point cloud and surfaces against user requirements.

* [Beamworx AutoPatch](https://www.beamworx.com/autopatch/) - Fully automated Multibeam Echosounder patch test calculator.
